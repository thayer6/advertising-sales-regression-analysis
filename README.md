# advertising-sales-regression-analysis

In this project, I analyze advertising sales data with four different linear regression models. Each model aims to predict the "sales" feature, a measure of product sales within a given market in thousands of dollars. The first three univariate linear regressions take a look at advertising dollars spent on TV, radio, and newspaper ads. The final model includes all three features (TV, radio, and newspaper ad sales) in a multivariate linear regression model.
